    <!-- STATEMENT -->
    <div class="ethics-statement">
        <p>
            My approach to ethics begins with my Christian faith, which teaches that every person has inherent worth and dignity.
            Technology is never neutral. It reflects the values of the people who design and deploy it, and I take that responsibility seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
            That belief shapes how I think about data, privacy, and power. Information represents real people, real stories,
            and real consequences. I believe data should be handled with honesty, restraint, and respect, never exploited simply
            because it is accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
            For me, good technology is not defined only by performance or scale. It is defined by whether it serves people well,
            minimizes harm, and can be defended not only in a technical review, but in conscience.

            <h2>Integrity</h2>
            <p>
                I believe integrity means doing the right thing even when it is inconvenient or unseen.
                In practice, this means refusing shortcuts that compromise accuracy, security, or trust.
                I aim to build systems that are honest in what they collect, store, and represent.

        <div class="ethics-card">
            <h2>Stewardship</h2>
            <p>
                Data, resources, and influence are entrusted, not owned. I view technology as something to steward wisely,
                not exploit aggressively. This includes protecting sensitive information, designing efficiently,
                and considering long-term impact rather than short-term gain.

            <p>
                Ethical technology considers the people affected by it, especially those with less power or visibility.
                I strive to design with empathy, accessibility, and fairness in mind, recognizing that real users
                live with the outcomes of design decisions.

            <h2>Accountability</h2>
            <p>
                I believe accountability means owning decisions, outcomes, and mistakes.
                When systems fail or harm occurs, responsibility should not be hidden behind complexity.
                Transparency and correction are essential to maintaining trust.

    <!-- PAPER -->
    <div class="ethics-paper">
        <h2>Ethics in Practice</h2>
        <p>
            In my coursework, I explored ethical challenges in technology including data privacy,
            algorithmic bias, responsibility in system design, and the tension between innovation and harm.
            These topics reinforced the importance of grounding technical decisions in clear moral principles.
        </p>
        <p>
            The paper addresses real-world scenarios where ethical clarity is tested by deadlines,
            incentives, and ambiguity, emphasizing the role of character and accountability in decision-making.
